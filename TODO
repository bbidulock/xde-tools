-- TODO file for XDE.  2013-10-21

* [ ] get xde-setbg to change and notify of gtkrc-2.0.xde changes.

* [ ] add startup notification to xde-session when launching autostart
  files.

* [ ] full X11 Session Management Protocol support for xde-session.

* [ ] add menu from xde-traymenu to xde-desktop.

* [ ] add menu from xde-traymenu to xde-panel.

* [ ] remove dependence on startup variables to determine window manager in
  all XDE tools

* [ ] provide mechanism (using Gtk2::Unique) to launch xde-traymenu menu
  from external program

* [ ] add window manager specific items to xde-traymenu.

* [ ] split off xde-setup as a bash script and have it perform setup
  of window manager user directories (preferrably in XDG_CONFIG_HOME)
  just before launching the window manager.  Split all setup directories
  into the separate package.

* [ ] provide a session management proxy for EWMH compliant window managers
  but with fallbacks that support non-EWMH/WMH compliant window
  managers.
