-- TODO file for XDE.  2013-10-21

- get xde-setbg to change and notify of gtkrc-2.0.xde changes.

- add startup notification to xde-session when launching autostart
  files.

- full X11 Session Management Protocol support for xde-session.

- add menu from xde-traymenu to xde-desktop.

- add menu from xde-traymenu to xde-panel.

- remove dependence on startup variables to determine window manager in
  all XDE tools

- provide mechanism (using Gtk2::Unique) to launch xde-traymenu menu
  from external program

- add window manager specific items to xde-traymenu.

- split off xde-setup as a bash script and have it perform setup
  of window manager user directories (preferrably in XDG_CONFIG_HOME)
  just before launching the window manager.  Split all setup directories
  into the separate package.

- provide a session management proxy for EWMH compliant window managers
  but with fallbacks that support non-EWMH/WMH compliant window
  managers.
