=head1 NAME

X11::SN::Sequence - module supporting startup notification sequences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a representation of an X11 startup notification
sequence.  Each startup notification sequence is identified by its
startup identifier.

=head1 PARAMETERS

The following parameters are normally used in startup notification
messages:

=over

=item C<ID>

The startup notification identifier.  Uniquely identifies a startup
sequence; should be some globally unique string.  This should normally
not be supplied and will be completed during the initiate() call. 

=item C<NAME>

Some human readable name of the item being started; for example,
C<Control Center> or C<Untitled Document>; this name should be
localized.

=item C<SCREEN>

The X screen number for the startup sequence.

=item C<BIN>

The name of the executable being started; i.e. C<argv[0]>.

=item C<ICON>

A string to be interpreted exactly as the C<Icon> field in XDG desktop
entries is intepreted.

=item C<DESKTOP>

The desktop (workspace) on which the application should appear, counting
from 0, as in C<_NET_WM_DESKTOP> or C<_WIN_WORKSPACE>.  However, this
value should never be interpreted by a window manager to override a
C<_NET_WM_DESKTOP> property set on a top-level window that is being
mapped.  This desktop is relative to the screen provided by the
C<SCREEN> key.

=item C<TIMESTAMP>

The X server timestamp of the user action that caused the launch.  For
example, a window manager that does not allow stealing focus by newly
mapped windows while the user works in an application can use this
timestamp for windows that have a matching, C<_NET_STARTUP_ID> property
if they do not have any C<_NET_WM_USER_TIME> property set or if
C<_NET_WM_USER_TIME> is older.  See
L<X11::Protocol::EWMH(3pm)/_NET_WM_USER_TIME> for details.

=item C<DESCRIPTION>

A short description suitable for display in a dialog that indicates what
is happening.  For example C<Opening document Foo> or C<Launching
KWord>.  The description should be in C<foo-ing whatever> format,
describing the current status.

=item C<WMCLASS>

A string to match against the C<res_name> or C<res_class> C<WM_CLASS>
hints.  If this key is present, the launchee will most likely not send a
C<remove> message on its own.  If the desktop environment detects a
top-level window mapped with this name or class, it should send a
C<remove> message for the startup sequence.  See also
L<X11::SN::Monitor(3pm)>.  Note that the class hint is in Latin-1, so
the value of this key must be converted to Latin-1 before strcmp'ing it
with the window res_class/res_name (though in all known cases only ASCII
is invoked so it does not matter).

=item C<SILENT>

A boolean (0/1) value: when set to 1, there should be no visual
feedback.  This can be used to suspend the visual feedback temporarily,
e.g. when the application shows a dialog during its startup before
mapping the main window.  Another use is for launch sequences for
applications that are neither compliant nor their C<WMClass> is known,
but which should preferrably have thier window mapped on the desktop
specified by the value of C<DESKTOP>.

This can also be used by a launcher that provides its own progress
notifications and does not wish another startup notification monitor to
display it as well.

=item C<APPLICATION_ID>

The XDG application identifier (without the F<.desktop> suffix).  This
is an application identifier for a desktop entry file that describes the
application being launched.  This is normally not a full path to the
desktop entry file, and does not necessarily contain the F<.desktop>
suffix.  Applications reading this parameter can use XDG rules to locate
the application file.

=back

Note that additional parameters may also be specified.  The contents of
each parameter should be an unquoted string.  X11::SN::Sequence will
perform quoting of the value before including it in a startup
notification message.

=head1 METHODS

The module provides the following methods:

=over

=item B<sn_quote>(I<$string>) => $quoted_string

Utility function to quote a key value string.

=cut

sub sn_quote {
    my $string = shift;
    my $need_quotes = 0;
    $need_quotes = 1 if $string =~ m{\s};
    $need_quotes = 1 if $string =~ s{\\}{\\\\}g;
    $need_quotes = 1 if $string =~ s{"}{\\"}g;
    $string = '"'.$string.'"' if $need_quotes;
    return $string;
}

=item $seq = X11::SN::Sequence->B<new>(I<$sn>, I<%params>)

Create a new startup notification sequence for the L<X11::SN(3pm)> startup
notification context, I<$sn>, with parameters, I<%params>.  The startup
notification context, I<$sn>, must be an instance of L<X11::SN(3pm>,
that is a I<launcher>, L<X11::SN::Launcher(3pm)>, a I<launchee>,
L<X11::SN::Launchee(3pm)> or a I<monitor>, L<X11::SN::Monitor(3pm)>.

The parameters, I<%params>, can have the keys described under
L</PARAMETERS>.

=cut

sub new { return bless {sn=>$sn,parms=>\%parms}, shift }

=item $seq->B<destroy>()

Creating an instance of an X11::SN::Sequence creates a circular
reference with the X11::SN which is used for event loops and
communicating with the X server.  This method remove the circular
reference so that the instance may be garbage collected.  No other
methods may be called after this method is called and the caller should
release its references to the object following its call to this method.

=cut

=item $seq->B<get_id>() => I<$startup_id>

=item $seq->B<get_startup_id>() => I<$startup_id>

Returns the startup notification identifier, I<$startup_id>, associated
with this startup notification sequence.

=cut

sub get_id { return shift->{parms}{ID} }
sub get_startup_id { return shift->{parms}{ID} }

=back

=head2 STATE METHODS

=over

=item $seq->B<initiate>(I<$launcher>, I<$launchee>, I<$timestamp>) => I<$id>

Initiates a startup notification sequence.  All the properties of the
launch (such as type, geometry, description) should be set up prior to
initiating the sequence.  The launcher name, I<$launcher>, is the name
of the launcher application, suitable for debug output.  The launchee
name, I<$launchee>, is the name of the launchee application, suitable
for debug output.  The timestamp (X11 Server Time), I<$timestamp>, is
the timestamp of the X11 event launching the application.  I<$timestamp>
is optional.  The startup id will be formated in the same way as is
performed by the Xorg F<libsn>.

This method will raise a warning if the startup notificaiton sequence
has already been initiated (i.e. get_initiated() returns true).

=cut

    delete $self->{changed};
    return $self->{id};
}

=item $seq->B<get_initiated>() => I<$boolean>

Returns a boolean, I<$boolean>, that indicates whether the sequence has
been initiated.

=cut

sub get_initiated { return shift->{initiated} }

=item $seq->B<change>()

Performs a change to the startup notification sequence by sending a
C<change> message if the sequence has changed since the previous C<new>
or C<change> message.

This method will raise a warning if the startup notification sequence
has not yet been initiated (get_initiated() returns false).

=cut

sub change {
    my $self = shift;
    return 0 unless $self->get_changed;
    my $msg = 'change:';
    my %included = ();

    delete $self->{changed};
    return 1;
}

=item $seq->B<get_changed>() => I<$boolean>

Returns a boolean, I<$boolean>, that reports whether the sequence has
changed since the last sent C<new> or C<change> message and whether
pending changes exist.

=cut

sub get_changed { return shift->{changed} }

=item $seq->B<complete>()

Completes the startup notification sequence.  This results in sending a
C<remove> message.

This method will raise a warning if the startup notification sequence
has not yet been initiated (get_initiated() returns false).  No warning
is issued if the completion was as a result of the receipt, rather than
generation, of a C<remove> message.

=cut

sub complete {
    my $self = shift;
    unless ($self->get_initiated) {
	warn "startup sequence not initiated!";
	return 0;

    $self->broadcast_message($msg);

    delete $self->{initiated};
    delete $self->{changed};
    return 1;
}

=item $seq->B<get_initiated_time>() => I<$tv_sec>, I<$tv_usec>

Returns the time at which the sequence was initiated.  Returns
C<undef> when the sequence has not yet been initiated (get_initiated()
returns false).
