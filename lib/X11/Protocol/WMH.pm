=head1 NAME

X11::Protocol::WMH -- provides methods for controlling window manager hints.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use X11::Protocol::WMH;

 my $wmh = X11::Protocol::WMH->new();

 $wmh->get_WIN_WORKSPACE();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a module with methods that can be used to control a WMH
compliant window manager.  Note: not all that many window managers are
WMH compliant anymore.  Many that are EWMH compliant have removed
support for WMH (like L<fluxbox(1)>).  Several that support
C<_WIN_DESKTOP_BUTTON_PROXY>, such as L<icewm(1)>, L<fvwm(1)>,
L<metacity(1)> still support WMH; however, L<icewm(1)> has not
received any development in some years (I updated it recently, see
L<http://github.com/bbidulock/icewm>.  L<fvwm(1)> would be the only
XDE-supported window manager that continues to be WMH compliant if
I had not added it to L<etwm(1)> and L<echinus(1)>.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are provided by this module.

=item B<WinClientMessage>(I<$X>,I<$window>,I<$type>,I<$data>)

=cut

sub WinClientMessage {
    my($X,$window,$type,$data) = @_;
    $window = 0 unless defined $window;
    $window = 0 if $window eq 'None';
    $window = $X->root unless $window;
    $type = ($type =~ m{^\d+$}) ? $type : $X->atom($type);
    $data = pack('LLLLL',@$data) if ref $data eq 'ARRAY';
    $X->SendEvent($X->root, 0,
	    $X->pack_event_mask('SubstructureNotify'),
	    $X->pack_event(
		name=>'ClientMessage',
		window=>$window,
		type=>$type,
		format=>32,
		data=>$data));
}

=head2 Detection of a GNOME compliant Window Manager

=head3 _WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK, CARDINAL/32

There is a single unambiguous way to detect if there currently is a GNOME
compliant Window Manager running.  It is the job of the Window Manager
to set up a few things to make this possible.  Using the following method
it is also possible for applications to detect compliance by receiving
an event when the Window Manager exits.

To do this the Window Manager should create a Window, that is a child of
the root window.  There is no need to map it, just create it.  The
Window Manager may reuse ANY window it has for this purpose - even if it
is mapped, just as long as the window is never destroyed while the
Window Manager is running.

Once the Window is created the Window Manager should set a property on
the root window of the name _WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK, and type CARDINAL.
The atom's data would be a CARDINAL that is the Window ID of the window
that was created above.  The window that was created would ALSO have
this property set on it with the same values and type.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK>(I<$X>,I<$window>) => I<$check> or undef

Returns the supporting window manager check window, I<$check>, or
C<undef> when no such window exists.  This method can support a certain
amount of race condition.

=cut

sub get_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK {
    return getWMRootPropertyRecursive($_[0],_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<set_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK>(I<$X>,I<$check>)

Sets the supporting window manager check window by setting the
C<_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK> property on both the window, I<$check>, and
the root window for I<$check>.  Only a window manager that owns the
C<WM_Sn> selection should call this function.

=cut

sub set_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK {
    return setWMRootPropertyRecursive($_[0],_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK=>WINDOW=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<dmp_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK>(I<$X>,I<$check>)

Prints to standard output the value of get_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK().

=cut

sub dmp_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK {
    return dmpWMRootPropertyUint($_[0],_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK=>check=>$_[1]);
}

=back

=head2 Listing GNOME Window Manager compliance

=cut

=head3 _WIN_PROTOCOLS, ATOM[]/32

Create a property on the root window of the atom name _WIN_PROTOCOLS.
This property contains a list (array) of atoms that are all the
properties the Window Manager supports.  These atoms are any number of
the following:

 _WIN_LAYER
 _WIN_STATE
 _WIN_HINTS
 _WIN_APP_STATE
 _WIN_EXPANDED_SIZE
 _WIN_ICONS
 _WIN_WORKSPACE
 _WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT
 _WIN_WORKSPACE_NAMES
 _WIN_CLIENT_LIST

 _WIN_AREA_COUNT            (not in wm-comp.pdf)
 _WIN_AREA                  (not in wm-comp.pdf)
 _WIN_DESKTOP_BUTTON_PROXY  (not in wm-comp.pdf)
 _WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK   (not in wm-comp.pdf)
 _WIN_WORKAREA              (not in wm-comp.pdf)

If you list one of these properties then you support it and applications
can expect information provided by, or accepted by the Window Manager to
work.


=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_PROTOCOLS>(I<$X>,I<$root>) => I<$names> or undef

Returns I<$names> as a reference to a hash of atom names or C<undef>
when no C<_WIN_PROTOCOL> property exists on root window, I<$root>.
I<$root>, when unspecified, defaults to C<$X-E<gt>root>.  Possible keys
are as described above under L</_WIN_PROTOCOLS>.

=cut

sub get_WIN_PROTOCOLS {
    return getWMRootPropertyAtoms($_[0],_WIN_PROTOCOLS=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<set_WIN_PROTOCOLS>(I<$X>,I<$names>)

Sets the C<_WIN_PROTOCOLS> property to the atoms of the names of the
array or hash referenced by I<$names>, or when I<$names> is undefined,
removes the C<_WIN_PROTOCOLS> property from the C<$X-E<gt>root> window.

Note that C<_WIN_PROTOCOLS> should only be set by a window manager (the
owner of the C<_WIN_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK> window).

=cut

sub set_WIN_PROTOCOLS {
    return setWMRootPropertyAtoms($_[0],_WIN_PROTOCOLS=>$_[1]);

=head2 Providing shortcuts managed clients

=head3 _WIN_CLIENT_LIST, CARDINAL[]/32

As an aide in having external applications be able to list and access
clients being managed by the Window Manager, a property should be set on
the root window of the name _WIN_CLIENT_LIST which is an array of type
CARDINAL.  Each entry is the Window ID of a managed client. If the list
of managed clients changes, clients are added or deleted, this list
should be updated.

Note that the values in the list are saved as type C<CARDINAL> even
though their contents are of type C<WINDOW>.

=head4 Methods

In the following methods, I<$clients> is a reference to an array
containing the list of XIDs for client windows.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_CLIENT_LIST>(I<$X>,I<$root>) => I<$clients> or undef

Returns the C<_WIN_CLIENT_LIST> property client list as an array
reference, I<$clients>, or C<undef> when no C<_WIN_CLIENT_LIST> property
is set on the root window, I<$root>.  When I<$root> is unspecified, it
defaults to C<$X-E<gt>root>.

=cut

sub get_WIN_CLIENT_LIST {
    return getWMRootPropertyUints($_[0],_WIN_CLIENT_LIST=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<set_WIN_CLIENT_LIST>(I<$X>,I<$clients>)

Sets the C<_WIN_CLIENT_LIST> property to the array referenced by
I<$clients> on the root window, or when I<$clients> is C<undef>, deletes
the C<_WIN_CLIENT_LIST> property from the root window.

Only a window manager should set the C<_WIN_CLIENT_LIST> property
directly in this way.

=cut

sub set_WIN_CLIENT_LIST {
    return setWMRootPropertyUints($_[0],_WIN_CLIENT_LIST=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<dmp_WIN_CLIENT_LIST>(I<$X>,I<$clients>)

=head2 Providing Multiple/Virtual Desktop information

=head3 _WIN_WORKSPACE, CARDINAL/32

The C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> property on the root window contains the currently
displayed workspace index, counting from zero.  When set on a client
window, C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> specifies the workspace on which the client
window should appear.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_WORKSPACE>(I<$X>,I<$window>) =>  I<$workspace>

Return the C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> property workspace, I<$workspace>, for the
specified window, I<$window>, or C<undef> when no C<_WIN_WORKSPACE>
property exists on I<$window>.  I<$workspace>, when defined, is the
scalar index of the workspace (counting from zero).  When I<$window> is
a root window, I<$workspace> is the index of the current workspace; for
a client window, the index of the workspace on which the client appears,
but see also L</_WIN_WORKSPACES>.

=cut

sub get_WIN_WORKSPACE {
    return getWMPropertyInt($_[0],$_[1],_WIN_WORKSPACE=>);
}

=item B<set_WIN_WORKSPACE>(I<$X>,I<$window>,I<$workspace>)

Set the C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> property workspace, I<$workspace>, for the
specified window, I<$window>, or when I<$workspace> is C<undef>, remove
the C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> property from I<$window>.  I<$workspace>, when
defined, is the scalar index of the workspace (counting from zero).

The client should only set C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> directly before initially
mapping a top-level window.  After mapping, req_WIN_WORKSPACE() should
be used instead.  C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> should only be set on the root
window by the window manager.  The client should use req_WIN_WORKSPACE()
to request that the window manager change the property.

=cut

sub set_WIN_WORKSPACE {
    return setWMPropertyInt($_[0],$_[1],_WIN_WORKSPACE=>CARDINAL=>$_[2]);

=item B<dmp_WIN_WORKSPACE>(I<$X>,I<$workspace>)

Prints to standard output the value of get_WIN_WORKSPACE().

=cut

sub dmp_WIN_WORKSPACE {
    return dmpWMPropertyInt($_[0],_WIN_WORKSPACE=>workspace=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<req_WIN_WORKSPACE>(I<$X>,I<$window>,I<$workspace>,I<$timestamp>)

Sends a C<_WIN_WORKSPACE> client message to the root window to change
the workspace, I<$workspace>, for the specified window, I<$window>, with
the X service time stamp, I<$timestamp>.  I<$window> defaults to the
default root window, I<$workspace> defaults to zero (0) and
I<$timestamp> defaults to C<CurrentTime>.

When a client window is specified for I<$window>, a change to the active
workspace on which the client window appears is requested, but see also
L</_WIN_WORKSPACES>.  When a root window is specified for I<$window>, or
I<$window> is C<None> or C<undef>, a change to the actively displayed
workspace is requested.

=cut

sub req_WIN_WORKSPACE {
    my($X,$window,$workspace,$timestamp) = @_;
    $timestamp = 0 unless $timestamp;
    $timestamp = 0 if $timestamp eq 'CurrentTime';

=head3 _WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT, CARDINAL/32

The C<_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT> root window property contains the number of
workspaces.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT>(I<$X>,I<$root>) => I<$count> or undef

Returns the C<_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT> property, I<$count>, from the root
window, or C<undef> when no C<_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT> property exists on
I<$root>.
When unspecified, I<$root> defaults to C<$X-E<gt>root>.
When defined, I<$count> is a scalar integer.

=cut

sub get_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT {
    return getWMRootPropertyUint($_[0],_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<set_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT>(I<$X>,I<$count>)

Sets the number of workspaces to I<$count>, or when I<$count> is
undefined, 
Sets the number of workspaces to C<$count>.  (This changes the root
window property and does not send client messages.)

When unspecified, I<$root> defaults to C<$X-E<gt>root>.

=cut

sub set_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT {
    return setWMRootPropertyUint($_[0],_WIN_WORKSPACE_COUNT=>CARDINAL=>$_[1]);

=head3 _WIN_WORKSPACE_NAMES, STRING[]/8

This property contains a list of null-separated name strings, one for
each desktop.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_WORKSPACE_NAMES>(I<$X>,I<$root>) => I<$names> or undef

=head3 _WIN_WORKAREA, CARDINAL[]/32

The C<_WIN_WORKAREA> property contains a list of minimum and maximum x
and y coordinates of the available work area.  The minimum coordinates
are the upper-left corner and the maximum coordinates are the
lower-right corner of the available area.  This is only set by the
window manager.

Note that even though the values specified are signed numbers, they are
stored in the property with type C<CARDINAL>.

=head4 Methods

In the methods that follow, I<$rectangle> is a reference to a hash
containing the following integer valued keys:

 minX   x-coordinate of work area upper-left  corner
 minY   y-coordinate of work area upper-left  corner
 maxX   x-coordinate of work area lower-right corner
 maxY   y-coordinate of work area lower-right corner

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_WORKAREA>(I<$X>,I<$root>) => I<$rectangle> or undef

Returns the C<_WIN_WORKAREA> property available work area, I<$rectangle>,

=head3 _WIN_CLIENT_MOVING, CARDINAL/32

This atom is a 32-bit integer that is either 0 or 1 (currently).  0
denotes everything is as per usual but 1 denotes that ALL configure
requests by the client on the client window with this property are not
just a simple "moving" of the window, but the result of a user move the
window BUT the client is handling that interaction by moving its own
window.  The window manager should respond accordingly by assuming any
configure requests for this window whilst this atom is "active" in the
"1" state are a client move and should handle flipping desktops if the
window is being dragged "off screen" or across desktop boundaries etc.
This atom is only ever set by the client.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_CLIENT_MOVING>(I<$X>,I<$window>) => I<$bool>

Returns the C<_WIN_CLIENT_MOVING> property, I<$bool>, from the window,
I<$window>, or C<undef> when the property does not exist on I<$window>.
When defined, I<$bool> is a boolean value (0 or 1).

=head2 Initial properties set on client window

When a client first maps a window, before calling XMapWindow, it will
set properties on the client window with certain atoms as their types.
The property atoms set can be any or all of _WIN_LAYER, _WIN_STATE,
_WIN_WORKSPACE, _WIN_EXPANDED_SIZE and _WIN_HINTS.

Each of these properties is of the type CARDINAL, and _WIN_EXPANDED_SIZE
is an array of 4 CARDINAL's. For the _WIN_STATE and _WIN_HINTS
properties, the bits set mean that state/property is desired by the
client.

The bitmask for _WIN_HINTS is as follows:

 #define WIN_HINTS_SKIP_FOCUS (1<<0) /*"alt-tab" skips this win*/
 #define WIN_HINTS_SKIP_WINLIST (1<<1) /*do not show in window list*/
 #define WIN_HINTS_SKIP_TASKBAR (1<<2) /*do not show on taskbar*/
 #define WIN_HINTS_GROUP_TRANSIENT (1<<3) /*Reserved - definition is unclear*/
 #define WIN_HINTS_FOCUS_ON_CLICK (1<<4) /*app only accepts focus if clicked*/

This is also a simple bitmask but only the application changes it, thus
whenever this property changes the Window Manager should re-read it and
honor any changes.  _WIN_WORKSPACE is a CARDINAL that is the Desktop
number the app would like to be on. This desktop number is updated by
the Window Manager after the window is mapped and until the window is
unmapped by the application. The value for this property is simply the
numeric for the desktop 0, being the first desktop available.

=head3 _WIN_STATE, CARDINAL/32

This property is of type CARDINAL.  The bits set mean that state is
desired by the client.  The bitmask for _WIN_STATE is as follows:

 #define WIN_STATE_STICKY          (1<<0) /* everyone knows sticky */
 #define WIN_STATE_MINIMIZED       (1<<1) /* Reserved - definition is unclear */
 #define WIN_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT  (1<<2) /* window in maximized V state */
 #define WIN_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORIZ (1<<3) /* window in maximized H state */
 #define WIN_STATE_HIDDEN          (1<<4) /* not on taskbar but window visible */
 #define WIN_STATE_SHADED          (1<<5) /* shaded (MacOS / Afterstep style) */
 #define WIN_STATE_HID_WORKSPACE   (1<<6) /* not on current desktop */
 #define WIN_STATE_HID_TRANSIENT   (1<<7) /* owner of transient is hidden */
 #define WIN_STATE_FIXED_POSITION  (1<<8) /* window is fixed in position even */
 #define WIN_STATE_ARRANGE_IGNORE  (1<<9) /* ignore for auto arranging */

These are a simple bitmasks - if the bit is set, that state is desired
by the application.  Once the application window has been mapped it is
the responsibility of the Window Manager to set these properties to the
current state of the Window whenever it changes states.  If the window
is unmapped the application is again responsible, if unmapped by the
application.

=head3 _WIN_EXPANDED_SIZE, CARDINAL[4]/32

The C<_WIN_EXPANDED_SIZE> property is an array of 4 C<CARDINAL> numers
as follows:

 x   CARD32  x-position of expanded window origin
 y   CARD32  y-position of expanded window origin
 w   CARD32  width of expanded window
 h   CARD32  height of expanded window

The
expanded space occupied is the area on the screen that the app's window
will occupy when "expanded".  That is, if you have a button on an app
that "hides" it by reducing its size, this is the geometry of the
expanded window - so the window manager can allow for this when doing
auto position of client windows assuming the app can at any point use
this area and thus try and keep it clear.  Only the client sets this.

=head4 Methods

In the following methods, I<$geometry> refers to a hash reference
containing the following keys (containing integer values):

 x    x-position of expanded window origin
 y    y-position of expanded window origin
 w    width  of expanded window
 h    height of expanded window

=head3 _WIN_APP_STATE, CARDINAL/32

The C<_WIN_APP_STATE> property contains the application state (also
"color reactiveness") - the application can keep changing this property
when it changes its state and the window manager or monitoring program
will pick this up and display something accordingly.  Only the client
sets this property.

=head4 Methods

In the methods that follow, I<$state> refers to an interpreted scalar of
type C<WindowAppState> that has the following interpreted value names
and symbolic constants:

=head2 State change requests

After an application has mapped a window, it may wish to change its own
state.  To do this the client sends ClientMessages to the root window
with information on how to change the application's state. Clients will
send messages as follows:

 Display *disp;
 Window root, client_window;
 XClientMessageEvent xev;
 CARD32 new_layer;

 xev.type = ClientMessage;
 xev.window = client_window;
 xev.message_type = XInternAtom(disp, XA_WIN_LAYER, False);
 xev.format = 32;
 xev.data.l[0] = new_layer;
 XSendEvent(disp, root, False, SubstructureNotifyMask, (XEvent *) &xev);

 Display *disp;
 Window root, client_window;
 XClientMessageEvent xev;
 CARD32 mask_of_members_to_change, new_members;

 xev.type = ClientMessage;
 xev.window = client_window;
 xev.message_type = XInternAtom(disp, XA_WIN_STATE, False);
 xev.format = 32;
 xev.data.l[0] = mask_of_members_to_change;
 xev.data.l[1] = new_members;
 XSendEvent(disp, root, False, SubstructureNotifyMask, (XEvent *) &xev);

If an application wishes to change the current active desktop it will
send a client message to the root window as follows:

 Display *disp;
 Window root, client_window;
 XClientMessageEvent xev;
 CARD32 new_desktop_number;

 xev.type = ClientMessage;
 xev.window = client_window;
 xev.message_type = XInternAtom(disp, XA_WIN_WORKSPACE, False);
 xev.format = 32;
 xev.data.l[0] = new_desktop_number;
 XSendEvent(disp, root, False, SubstructureNotifyMask, (XEvent *) &xev);

If the Window Manager picks up any of these ClientMessage events it
should honor them.

=head2 Button press and release forwarding for the desktop window

X imposes the limitation that only 1 client can be selected for button
presses on a window - this is due to the implicit grab nature of button
press events in X. This poses a problem when more than one client wishes
to select for these events on the same window - E.g., the root window,
or in the case of a WM that has more than one root window (virtual
root windows) any of these windows. The solution to this is to have the
client that receives these events handle any of the events it is
interested in, and then "proxy" or "pass on" any events it does not care
about. The traditional model has always been that the WM selects for
button presses on the desktop, it is only natural that it keep doing
this BUT have a way of sending unwanted presses onto some other
process(es) that may well be interested.

This is done as follows:

=over

=item 1.

Set a property on the root window called _WIN_DESKTOP_BUTTON_PROXY.  It
is of the type cardinal - its value is the Window ID of another window
that is not mapped and is created as an immediate child of the root
window. This window also has this property set on it pointing to itself.

 Display *disp;
 Window root, bpress_win;
 Atom atom_set;
 CARD32 val;

 atom_set = XInternAtom(disp, "_WIN_DESKTOP_BUTTON_PROXY", False);
 bpress_win = ECreateWindow(root, -80, -80, 24, 24, 0);
 val = bpress_win;
 XChangeProperty(disp, root, atom_set, XA_CARDINAL, 32,

 PropModeReplace, (unsigned char *)&val, 1);
 XChangeProperty(disp, bpress_win, atom_set, XA_CARDINAL, 32,
     PropModeReplace, (unsigned char *)&val, 1);

=item 2.

Whenever the WM gets a button press or release event it can check the
button on the mouse pressed, any modifiers, etc. - if the WM wants the
event it can deal with it as per normal and not proxy it on - if the WM
does not wish to do anything as a result of this event, then it should
pass the event along like the following:

 Display *disp;
 Window bpress_win;
 XEvent *ev;
 
 XUngrabPointer(disp, CurrentTime);
 XSendEvent(disp, bpress_win, False, SubstructureNotifyMask, ev);

where ev is a pointer to the actual Button press or release event it
receives from the X Server (retaining timestamp, original window ID,
coordinates etc.) NB - the XUngrabPointer is only required before
proxying a press, not a release.

The WM should proxy both button press and release events. It should only
proxya release if it also proxied the press corresponding to that
release.  It is the responsibility of any applications listening for
these events (and as many applications as want to can since they are
being sent under the guise of SubstructureNotify events), to handle
grabbing the pointer again and handling all events for the mouse while
pressed until release etc.

=head3 _WIN_DESKTOP_BUTTON_PROXY, CARDINAL/32

Note that the proxy window is save as type C<CARDINAL> even though its
contents are of type C<WINDOW>.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_DESKTOP_BUTTON_PROXY>(I<$X>,I<$root>) => I<$proxy>

C<undef> if no such window exists.

=head2 Desktop Areas as opposed to multiple desktops

The best way to explain this is as follows. Desktops are completely
geometrically disjoint workspaces. They have no geometric relevance to
each other in terms of the client window plane. Desktop Areas have
geometric relevance - they are next to, above, or below each other. The
best examples are FVWM's desktops and virtual desktops - you can have
multiple desktops that are disjoint and each desktop can be N x M
screens in size - these N x M areas are what are termed "desktop areas"
for the purposes of this document and the WM API.  If your WM supports
both methods like FVMW, Enlightenment and possible others, you should
use _WIN_WORKSPACE messages and atoms for the geometrically disjoint
desktops - for geometrically arranged desktops you should use the
_WIN_AREA messages and atoms.  If you only support one of these it is
preferable to use _WIN_WORKSPACE only.  The API for _WIN_AREA is very
similar to _WIN_WORKSPACE.

=cut

=head3 _WIN_AREA_COUNT, CARDINAL[]/32

To advertise the size of your areas (E.g., N x M screens in size) you
set an atom on the root window as follows:

 Display *disp;
 Window root;
 Atom atom_set;
 CARD32 val[2];

 atom_set = XInternAtom(disp, "_WIN_AREA_COUNT", False);
 val[0] = number_of_screens_horizontally;
 val[1] = number_of_screens_vertically;
 XChangeProperty(disp, root, atom_set, XA_CARDINAL, 32,
	 PropModeReplace, (unsigned char *)val, 2);

=head4 Methods

In the methods that follow, I<$count> is a reference to an array of two
values: columns and rows, respectively.

=over

=cut

=item B<get_WIN_AREA_COUNT>(I<$X>,I<$root>) => I<$count>

Get the number of columns and rows of screens provided by the large
desktop area.  When large desktops are not supported, this value will be
(1,1).

=cut

sub get_WIN_AREA_COUNT {
    return getWMRootPropertyUints($_[0],_WIN_AREA_COUNT=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<set_WIN_AREA_COUNT>(I<$X>,I<$count>)

Set the number of columns and rows of screens provided by the large
desktop area.  When large desktops are not supported, this value will
always be (1,1).

=cut

sub set_WIN_AREA_COUNT {
    return setWMRootPropertyUints($_[0],_WIN_AREA_COUNT=>$_[1]);
}

=item B<dmp_WIN_AREA_COUNT>(I<$X>,I<$count>)

Prints to standard output the value of get_WIN_AREA_COUNT().

=cut

sub dmp_WIN_AREA_COUNT {
    return dmpWMRootPropertyUints($_[0],_WIN_AREA_COUNT=>'cols, rows',$_[1]);
}

=back

=head3 _WIN_AREA, CARDINAL[]/32

To advertise which desktop area is currently the active one:

 Display *disp;
 Window root;
 Atom atom_set;
 CARD32 val[2];

 atom_set = XInternAtom(disp, "_WIN_AREA", False);
 val[0] = current_active_area_x; /* starts at 0 */
 val[1] = current_active_area_y; /* starts at 0 */
 XChangeProperty(disp, root, atom_set, XA_CARDINAL, 32,
	 PropModeReplace, (unsigned char *)val, 2);

If a client wishes to change what the current active area is they simply send a
client message like:

 Display *disp;
 Window root;
 XClientMessageEvent xev;

 xev.type = ClientMessage;
 xev.window = root;
 xev.message_type = XInternAtom(disp, "_WIN_AREA", False);
 xev.format = 32;
 xev.data.l[0] = new_active_area_x;
 xev.data.l[1] = new_active_area_y;
 XSendEvent(disp, root, False, SubstructureNotifyMask, (XEvent *) &xev);
