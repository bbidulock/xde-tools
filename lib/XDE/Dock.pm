=head1 NAME

XDE::Dock -- XDE Dock for WMs that do not provide one

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $xde = XDE::Dock->new(%OVERRIDES,ops=>\%ops);
 $xde->getenv;
 $xde->default;
 $SIG{TERM} = sub{$xde->main_quit};
 $xde->init;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A number of light-weight window managers supported by XDE provide a
WindowMaker-like Dock: L<fluxbox(1)>, L<blackbox(1)>, L<openbox(1)>,
L<pekwm(1)>, L<wmaker(1)>.  Of these, L<pekwm(1)> provides a suboptimal
dock (it does not center swallowed windows); and L<wmaker(1)>'s dock is
far too manual (it needs to launch the dock applications itself,
unavailable dock applications still show a window position.).  All of
these window managers are capable of disabling the dock functionality
through configuration.  Other window managers supported by L<XDE(3pm)>
do not provide a dock (per say): L<icewm(1)>, L<jwm(1)>, L<fvwm(1)>,
L<afterstep(1)>, L<metacity(1)>.  Of these, L<fvwm(1)> and
L<afterstep(1)> provide the ability to I<swallow> a dock application,
but this, again, requires manual configuration.

This is an application-based dock which performs much like the automatic
docks of the I<*box> window managers, however, it is standalone.

Another objective of this module is to provide increased functionality
over the I<*box> window managers as follows:

=over

=item 1.

Restore some of the more desirable WindowMaker behaviour to the dock.
This includes getting the dock to launch the dock applications when it
starts up, however, unlike WindowMaker, do not include space for dock
applications that are not available.  Drawers.  Drag and Drop
repositioning.  Drag and Drop addition and deletion.

=item 2.

Provide an XDG-based menu for adding dock apps to the dock.  That is,
provide a selection of doc apps to add and provide a way for the user to
specify arguments to the launch command.

=head1 METHODS

This module provides the following methods:

=head2 Initialization Methods

This module has the following initialization methods:

=over

=cut

=item B<new> XDE::Dock I<%OVERRIDES> => $dock

Creates an instance of an XDE::Dock object.  The XDE::Dock module uses
the L<XDE::Context(3pm)> module as a base, so the C<%OVERRIDES> are
simply passed to the L<XDE::Context(3pm)> module.

=cut

sub new {
    return XDE::Context::new(@_);
}

=item $dock->B<_init>() => $dock

Performs initialization for just this module.  Called after
L<XDE::Dual(3pm)> is fully initialized.  The actions performed are as
follows:

=over

=item 1.

The L<Linux::Inotify2(3pm)> connection is established and initiated.

=item 2.

The icon search path is initialized.

=item 3.

L<X11::Protocol(3pm)> extensions are initialized.

=item 4.

The EWMH/WMH/ICCCM environment is initialized.

=item 5.

Registration is perform on the root window to receive C<PropertyChange>
and C<SubstructureNotify> events.

=item 6.

A window is created to act as the parent for toplevel windows that are
reparented that do not correspond to the dock application window itself.

=item 7.

The dock window itself is created and dock applications searched and
reparented by calling the B<create_dock> method.

    $self->create_dock;
    return $self;
}

=item $dock->B<_term>() => $dock

Performs termination just for this module.  Called before
L<XDE::Dual(3pm)> terminates.  The proper action to take here is to
reparent any windows that we have swallowed back to the root window so
that the window manager can take control of them or at least so that the
dock apps do not terminate when we don't want them to.

We change the save set of any windows that we reparent to the
L<X11::Protocol> window, so they should be reparented back to root on
their own; however, any windows that we have added to a L<Gtk2::Socket>
needs to be reparented away from the socket and back to root.

=head2 General Methods

This modules has the following general methods:

Creates the window for the dock and then embeds the dock aps that it can
find.

    $self->{dock}{apps} = 0;
    $self->find_dockapp_clients;
}

=item $dock->B<withdraw_window>(I<$X>,I<$win>) => $result

This method uses the X11::Protocol::Connection, C<$X>, to withdraw the
window, C<$win>.  The purpose here is to withdraw the window so that the
window manager will cease managing the window (as is required by the
ICCCM), in preparation for reparenting the window to the dock.

This method relies on ICCCM compliance.  Window managers are supposed to
reparent back to root any top-level window that was previously mapped
and reparented when they are unmapped by the client.

=cut

sub withdraw_window {
    my ($self,$X,$win) = @_;
    my $xid = $win->{window};
    my $return = 0;

			));
	}
	$X->GetScreenSaver;
    }
    return $return;
}

=item $dock->B<test_window>(I<$X>,I<$xid>) => $result

Using the X11::Protocol::Connection, C<$X>, test the window, C<$win>, to
see whether it is a dock application and whether it should be
repartented to the dock.  This method returns true (1) when the window
is a dock application and false (0) when it is not.

This is an internal methods meant to be called from an event handler or
when initially searching the window stack for currently running dock
apps.

Some variations handled:

=over

=item 1.

Some dockapps use their toplevel window as the C<icon_window> as well.

=item 2.

Some dockapps use only their toplevel window and have no C<icon_window>.

=item 3.

Some dockapps have a toplevel window with an C<icon_window> that points
to itself!

=item 4.

Some dockapps use a separate toplevel window as the C<icon_window>.

=item 5.

Some dockapps make the C<icon_window> a child of their top-level window,
presumably so that WM's will map the child with the top-level if it
doesn't understand windows being mapped in the withdrawn state.  When
the C<icon_window> is a child of the toplevel, we do not want to steal
it away from its parent because it will be reparented to root on the way
out.  Therefore, when the C<icon_window> is a child of the toplevel, we
do not want to withdraw it and we want to reparent only the toplevel.

=item $dock->B<search_window>(I<$X>,I<$win>)

Uses the L<X11::Protocol::Connection(3pm)>, C<$X>, to search for dock
application windows in the subtree rooted at the window, C<$win>.  The
search stops when a dock application is found in the subtree.

This is an internal method intended on being called at startup.

Uses the L<X11::Protocol::Connection(3pm)>, C<$X>, to search for dock
application windows in the children of the window, C<$win>.  The search
is executed for each child regardless of whether dock application was
found in a sibling.

Uses the L<X11::Protocol::Connection(3pm)>, C<$X>, to search for dock

dock of their own.  That is, this might not work for: L<fluxbox(1)>,
L<blackbox(1)>, L<openbox(1)>, L<pekwm(1)>, and L<wmaker(1)>; but, it is
intended to work for L<icewm(1)>, L<jwm(1)>, L<fvwm(1)>, L<afterstep(1)>,

=item $dock->B<swallow>(I<$win>)

Swallows the window, C<$win>, by reparenting it into the dock.

Wrinkles:

=over

=item 1.

When the C<icon_window> is a child of its top-level window, we want to
reparent the top-level and not the child.

=item 2.

When the C<icon_window> is its own top-level, we might have been
withdrawing it and we just haven't received the event at this point...

=item 3.

If the C<icon_window> is its own top-level window, independent of the
toplevel for which it is the C<icon_window>, we will need to wait for
it to appear on its own before reparenting can be done.

=item 4.

In the complex case where the C<icon_window> has a different top-level
window that the withdrawn dock application window, just reparent the
icon window.

=back

Reparenting is performed using the L<Gtk2::Socket(3pm)> mechanism.

=head2 Event Handlers

=over

=item $dock->B<event_handler_CreateNotify>(I<$e>,I<$X>,I<$v>)

Event handler for when top-level windows are created.  Whenever a
top-level window is created we want to subscribe to property changes so
that we can determine when to check WM_HINTS for the tell-tale indicator
of a windowmaker dock application: initial_state of C<WithdrawnState>.

This handler currently does nothing!

=head1 WINDOW MANAGERS

Each XDE-supported window manager behaves a little differently when it
comes to dock apps as follows:

=over

=item L<fluxbox(1)>

L<fluxbox(1)> provides its own dock (called a "slit").

=over

=item *

WindowMaker and KDE dock apps are automatically swallowed to the dock
(based on being mapped in the C<WithdrawnState>).

=item *

Facility is provided to position and autohide the dock.

=item *

Styles support the dock.

=item *

Some native facility is provided for positioning dock apps.

=item *

No provision is provided for restarting dock apps startup and session
management of dock apps is unsupported and problematic.

=item *

L<fluxbox(1)> does not support X session management and improperly
failes to set the C<WM_STATE> property on swallowed dock apps (and,
therefore, session management proxies such as L<smproxy(1)> will not
save and restore dock app settings.

=back

=item L<blackbox(1)>

L<blackbox(1)> provides its own dock (called a "slit").

=over

=item *

WindowMaker dock apps are automatically swallowed to the dock.
Styles support the dock.

=item *

KDE applications are not automatically swallowed to the dock and
a separate KDE dock is necessary to support KDE dock apps.

=item *

Facility is provided for positionining and autohiding the dock.

=item *

No facility is provided to position applications within the dock.

=item *

No provision is provided for restarting dock apps; startup and session
management of dock apps is unsupported and problematic.

=item *

L<blackbox(1)> does not support X session management and improperly fails
to set the C<WM_STATE> property on swallowed dock apps (and, therefore,
session management proxies such as L<smproxy(1)> will not save and
restore dock app settings.

=back

=item L<openbox(1)>

L<openbox(1)> provides its own dock.

=over

=item *

WindowMaker dock apps are automatically swallowed to the dock.

=item *

Styles support the dock.

=item *

KDE applications are not automatically swallowed to the dock and a
separate KDE dock is necessary to support KDE dock apps.

=item *

Facility is provided for positioning and autohiding the dock.

=item *

No facility is provided for positioning applications within the dock.

=item *

No provision is provided for restarting dock apps; startup and session
managemen of dock apps is problematic.

=item *

L<openbox(1)> supports X session management; however, it improperly
fails to set the C<WM_STATE> property on swallowed dock apps (and,
therefore session management proxies such as L<smproxy(1)> will not save
and restore dock app settings.

=item *

It is questionable whether L<openbox(1)> saves the state of dock app
windows at all.

=back

=item L<icewm(1)>

IceWM does not provide a dock.  It is able to swallow applications into
its internal panel.
L<icewm(1)> treats windows with the C<WithdrawnState> as the initial
state in window hints as C<DontCareState>.

=item L<jwm(1)>

JWM does not provide a dock.  It is able to swallow applications into
its internal panel.

=item L<pekwm(1)>

PEK provides its own dock (called a "harbour").  WindowMaker dock apps
are atuomatically swallowed to the dock.

=item L<wmaker(1)>

Window Maker provides its own dock.  Applications 

=item L<fvwm(1)>

=item L<afterstep(1)>

=item L<metacity(1)>

=item L<wmx(1)>

=item L<ctwm(1)>

L<ctwm(1)> does not provide its own dock.  It does, however, support
window boxes that are capable of swallowing applications.  In general,
it should not be too difficult to extend the winbox mechanism to provide
a dock that automatically swallows dock apps.
L<ctwm(1)> treats windows with the C<WithdrawnState> as the initial
state in window hints as C<DontCareState>.

=item L<vtwm(1)>

L<vtwm(1)> does not provide its own dock.
L<vtwm(1)> treats windows with the C<WithdrawnState> as the initial
state in window hints as C<DontCareState>.

=item L<twm(1)>

L<twm(1)> treats windows with the C<WithdrawnState> as the initial
state in window hints as C<DontCareState>.


=item B<unknown>

When B<XDE::Dock> encounters a window manager that it does not directly
support, it falls back to default behaviour.  Default behavior is to
look for toplevel windows and client windows in the C<_NET_CLIENT_LIST>
that have an initial state of C<WithdrawnState> and perform ICCCM
unmapping requests on their toplevels.


=back

=head1 BUGS

Currently B<xde-dock> is not reparenting the dock applications back to
root when the program terminates:

=over

=item 1.

When the program terminates with C<SIGTERM>, we should catch the signal
and reparent all of the dock applications back to the root and request
of the window manager that they be mapped.

=item 2.

When the program terminates with C<SIGKILL>, the only way to reparent
the windows back to root and map them is by adding them to our
save-list.  Unfortunately, we are using Gdk/Gtk2 for the reparenting, so
we have to figure a way to get Gdk/Gtk2 to add the windows to its save
list.
