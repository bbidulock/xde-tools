XDE::Desktop::Icon::File2 -- desktop file (take 2)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $file = XDE::Desktop::Icon::File2->B<new>(I<$desktop>,I<$filename>,I<$x>,I<$y>)

Creates an instance of an XDE::Desktop::Icon::File object.  A file
corresponds to a normal file in the F<Desktop> directory that may be
opened with an application.  C<$desktop> is an instance of an
XDE::Desktop object, and C<$filename> is the full path and file name of
the F<.desktop> file to which the file corresponds.  C<$x> and
C<$y> are the x- and y-coordinates of the upper-left corner of the cell
on the desktop at which to render the icon and label.

This method identifies the icon and label associated with the file and
then calls XDE::Desktop::Icon->new() to create the desktop icon.  The
icon is based on the detected mime type of the file; the label is simply
the filename.
