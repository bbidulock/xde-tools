XDE::Glib -- a Glib implementation object for an XDE context

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a package based on L<XDE::Context(3pm)> that provides a Glib
implementation object for the XDE context.  This package integrates the
Glib event loop into an XDE context.

Obtains a new B<XDE::Glib> object.  For the use of I<%OVERRIDES> see
L<XDE::Context(3pm)>.  This package is based on the L<XDE::Context(3pm)>
package and simply calls its C<new> method with all agruments intact.

    return XDE::Context::new(@_);
}

This package does not do anything yet as we have not yet had a need to
integrate just the Glib event loop (without Gtk2).
